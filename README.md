# Trident-Experimental


Repository for Mods by me for the Voron Trident 3D Printer

This is a developement repository. Assume that all uploads are untested. There is absolutely no warranty on anything.

Feel free to open issues or contact me directly in case you find any bugs.

PLEASE NOTE:
My Trident is a 235x235 bed in a 250mm Frame. Also, I use 280mm MGN12H Rails. There is no guarantee that Mods fit on stock builds.
This is certainly true for the PurgeBucket and the Idler-Less front AB Drives
